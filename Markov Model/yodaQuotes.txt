Do or do not. There is no try.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.
Wars not make one great.
You must unlearn what you have learned.
The greatest teacher, failure is.
Always in motion is the future.
Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?
Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things.
Much to learn, you still have.
Control, control, you must learn control!
Named must your fear be before banish it you can.
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is.
Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you.
You will find only what you bring in.
Patience you must have, my young Padawan.
Clear your mind must be, if you are to find the villains behind this plot.
To be Jedi is to face the truth and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle or the night.
Much to learn, you still have.
To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not. In this war, a danger there is, of losing who we are.
In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.
Not if anything to say about it I have.
Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.
Decide you must, how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could, but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is.
Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future, the past, old friends long gone.
Control, control, you must learn control!
Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
Size matters not. Judge me by my size, do you?
Mediocre, my mind is not.
Blind we are, if creation of this clone army we could not see.
The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun the Clone War has.
When you look at the dark side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back.
If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are… a different game you should play.
In this war, a danger there is of losing who we are.
Much to learn you still have, my old padawan. This is just the beginning!
Hard to see, the dark side is.
Not if anything to say about it I have.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
On many long journeys have I gone. And waited, too, for others to return from journeys of their own. Some return; some are broken; some come back so different only their names remain.
To be Jedi is to face the truth and choose.
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not.
Ready are you? What know you of ready?
Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future, the past, old friends long gone.
Not if anything to say about it I have.
Much to learn, you still have.
Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?
If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
You will find only what you bring in.
You must unlearn what you have learned.
In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.
Reckless he is. Matters are worse.
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is.
Decide you must, how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could, but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?
Do or do not. There is no try. But do it, you must.
Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing.
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not.
Much to learn, you still have. Even funny jokes, you lack.
Afraid to learn, are you? Afraid to laugh, you should be!
The greatest teacher, failure is. Except maybe for a really good joke.
Already know you that which you need.
Judge me by my size, do you? And well you should not! For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is.
Sleep, I need. Yes, much rest I do. Tired, I am.
A Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side.
Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
That is why you fail.
Always pass on what you have learned.
Around the survivors, a perimeter create.
To die for one’s people is a great sacrifice. To live for one’s people, an even greater sacrifice.
We are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.
In the Force, everything is. Even between land and ship.
Your weapons, you will not need them.
No longer certain that one ever does win a war, I am.
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
A challenge lifelong it is, to unlearn what you have learned.
In the end, the shadow is all we see.
In stillness, answers come. In chaos, lessons hide.
A mountain becomes sand, grain by grain. Patience, the Jedi’s chisel is.
To see the galaxy, close your eyes you must. To hear the Force, quiet your thoughts you will.
The strongest roots grow in stormy soils. Comfort, weakness breeds.
Yesterday’s shadow, tomorrow’s light cannot touch. Now, the only moment that is.
A river carves stone not through force, but through persistence. Teach you this, the Jedi Code does.
To hold starlight in your palm, open your hand you must. To keep wisdom in your heart, release your pride you will.
Echoes of the past, the future’s architects are. Choose carefully which ghosts you heed.
A candle that burns for others, brighter shines than a bonfire of selfishness.
The tightest grip, sand slips through. The open palm, the galaxy holds.
The roots of wisdom, deep they grow. Water them with patience, you must.
In silent stars, truth whispers. Listen with your soul, not your ears.
A leaf in the storm, the Jedi remains. Bend, but never break.
Three suns rise, three suns set. Constant remains the Force.
The echo of kindness, louder than thunder it becomes.
Two paths before you always: one of light, one of shadow. Choose with care, you must.
The sharpest blade, words can be. Wield them wisely.
Like morning fog, doubt appears. Burned away by daylight's truth, it is.
The greatest battles, within fought they are. Victory over self, the true test.
A mountain of sand, grain by grain built. Great things from small beginnings grow.
The shadow of tomorrow, today's light casts. Fear not what has not come.
Empty your cup, if fill it you wish. Unlearn to learn.
The river's song, stones understand best. Listen like rock, you should.
In the spider's web, danger and beauty dwell. Choose your path carefully.
The weakest flame, darkness fears most. Small light, great purpose.
Five seasons a tree sees, yet still grows. Adapt, Jedi must.
The wise frog, both pond and lily pad knows. See all perspectives, you should.
Tomorrow's bread, today's yeast makes. Prepare always.
The child's question, the master's answer contains. Listen to innocence.
Seven times fall, eight times rise. This the Jedi way.
The tightest knot, patience unties. Force it not.
In the desert's heart, water hidden lies. Seek and you will find.
The moon's reflection, the lake's surface breaks. Stillness reveals truth.
A storm approaches. Shelter take in your center, you must.
The weightless feather, the hurricane survives. Bend with change.
Three breaths: one for past, one for present, one for future. Breathe them all.
The unread book, many lessons holds. Open your mind first.
The prisoner's chains, forged from within. Free yourself through acceptance.
The seedling's strength, the storm tests. Grow through adversity.
In the cocoon's darkness, wings form. Trust the process, young Padawan
